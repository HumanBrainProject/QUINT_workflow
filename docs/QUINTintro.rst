**What is QUINT?**
==================

.. tip::   
   **Visit** `EBRAINS <https://ebrains.eu/service/quint/>`_ **for more information about QUINT.**

The QUINT workflow comprises a flexible suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification of labelled features in series of histological images from mouse or rat brain. All the software are GUI-based, with no coding ability required. It generates counts and % coverage per atlas-region, in addition to point clouds for visualising the features in 3D. QUINT involves several defined steps:

1. Image preparation using **Nutil**.
2. Atlas-registration with **QuickNII, VisuAlign and/or DeepSlice**. They support registration of the images to a reference atlas such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas or the Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat. Linear registration is first performed using QuickNII, then VisuAlign allows refinement of the registration using non-linear methods. For coronal mouse brain sections, DeepSlice can automate the linear registration step.  
3. Feature extraction with **Ilastik** or another image analysis tool. 
4. Quantification with **Nutil**.
5. Optional quality control with **QCAlign**: it supports quality control of the section images, as well as quality control of the atlas-registration. It also enables exploration of the atlas hierarchy and creation of a customized level for the quantification.
6. Visualisation with the **Meshview Atlas Viewer**.

**Examples of use**
----------------------------------

QUINT supports histological sections from mouse and rat brain that have been labelled to reveal features. It works for sections cut at any angle of orientation, for complete as well as partial brain sections, and for sections affected by distortion. It can be used for:

* Cell count analysis
* To spatially characterise pathology
* Analyse tract tracing connections
