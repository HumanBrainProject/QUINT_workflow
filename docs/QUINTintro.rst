The QUINT workflow comprises a flexible suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification of labelled features in series if images of histological sections from mouse or rat brains. The QUINT workflow generates counts and % coverage per atlas-region, in addition to point clouds for visualising the features in 3D atlas space. All the software are GUI-based and easy to operate, with no requirement for coding ability. 

QUINT has three The workflow is composed of 5 distinct  

The QuickNII, VisuAlign and DeepSlice software support registration of the images to a reference atlas of the brain such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas or the Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat. The Ilastik software supports feature extraction based on image segmentation. The Nutil software supports the pre-processing of histological images


comprises the software QuickNII, VisuAlign, ilastik and Nutil, and allows atlas-based quantification of labelled features in serial histological images from mouse or rat brains.
