**What is QUINT?**
-----------------------

.. tip::   
   **Extract, quantify and analyse labelling**: **visit** `EBRAINS <https://ebrains.eu/service/quint/>`_ **for more information about QUINT.**

The QUINT workflow comprises a flexible suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification of labelled features in series of histological images from mouse or rat brain: 
* It generates counts and % coverage per atlas-region, in addition to point clouds for visualising the features in 3D atlas space. 
* All the software are GUI-based, with no coding ability required to operate.
* **QuickNII, VisuAlign and DeepSlice** enable registration of the images to a reference atlas such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas or the Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat. 
* **Ilastik** enables feature extraction based on supervised machine-learning.
* **Nutil** is a pre- and post-processing toolbox that supports pre-processing of the images as well as the final quantification step.
* **QCAlign** supplies functionality for quality control of the section images, as well as quality control of the atlas-registration.
* **Meshview** is a brain atlas viewer for visualising the point clouds in 3D.

**What data does QUINT support?**
-----------------------------------------

The QUINT workflow supports all types of histological sections from mouse and rat brain that has been labelled to reveal features:

* Cell count analysis
* Spatial distribution of pathology
* Analyse tract tracing connections
* Sections cut at any angle of orientation
* Partial brain sections
* Brain sections that are distorted
* Transgenic animals
