**What is QUINT?**
-----------------------

.. tip::   
   **Extract, quantify and analyse labelled features from histological mouse and rat brain images**. **Visit** `EBRAINS <https://ebrains.eu/service/quint/>`_ **for more information about QUINT.**

- The QUINT workflow comprises a flexible suite of software designed to support atlas-based quantification of labelled features in series of histological images from mouse or rat brain. 
- The QUINT workflow generates counts and % coverage per atlas-region, in addition to point clouds for visualising the features in 3D atlas space. 
- All the software are GUI-based, with no re require coding ability to operate.

QUINT software

The QuickNII, VisuAlign and DeepSlice support registration of the images to a reference atlas such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas or the Waxholm Atlas of the Sprague Dawley rat. The Ilastik software supports feature extraction based on image segmentation. The Nutil software supports the pre-processing of histological images.


comprises the software QuickNII, VisuAlign, ilastik and Nutil, and allows atlas-based quantification of labelled features in serial histological images from mouse or rat brains.
