**VisuAlign**
--------------

* VisuAlign allows in-plane refinement of the QuickNII registration using non-linear methods. 
* This is a manual process using drop and drag of markers placed on the image. 
* This step is optional, but can be used to adjust for distortions as well as anatomical differences between brains.
