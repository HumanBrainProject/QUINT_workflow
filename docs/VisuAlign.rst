**VisuAlign**
--------------

The linear registration of the sections to the reference atlas is performed with QuickNII. VisuAlign allows in-plane refinement of the registration using non-linear methods. This is a manual process using drop and drag of markers placed on the image. It can be used to adjust for distortions, as well as anatomical differences between brains.
