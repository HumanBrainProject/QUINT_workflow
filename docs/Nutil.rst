Nutil is a pre- and post-processing toolbox for histological images. It is an integral part of the QUINT workflow, enabling image transformations, file format conversion and renaming of files in order to prepare images for the QuickNII and ilastik software. It also supports the final quantification step in the workflow. Nutil has four features: 

1. TiffCreator: convert JPEG, PNG and normal TIFF images to tiled TIFF format.

2. Transform: rename, rotate, resize and compile thumbnails of large tiled TIFF images (typical microscopy output format).

3. Resize: for resizing JPEG/PNG images with output in PNG format.

4. Quantifier: for the batch extraction, quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in mouse or rat brain sections.
