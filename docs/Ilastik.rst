* Ilastik is a supervised machine learning tool for feature extraction by segmentation.
* The segmentations from ilastik are not directly compatible with Nutil but must be converted to RGB format with a tool such as FIJI. This is to allow a visual validation step prior to quantification. Instructions for how to do this are found in the user documentation.
