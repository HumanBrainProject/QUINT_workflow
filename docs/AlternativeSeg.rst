**Alternative tools**
-----------------------

.. tip::

    `QuPath: <https://qupath.github.io/QuPath>`_ is an alternative that can be used to generate the segmentations. In some cases QuPath may perform better than ilastik.

    `FIJI: <https://imagej.net/software/fiji/>`_ is also useful for generating segmentations. 

Any image analysis software may be used to generate the segmentations as long as they meet the requirements of the Nutil software listed `here <https://nutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/QuantifierInput.html#preparing-the-segmentations>`_.
