**DeepSlice**
------------

* DeepSlice performes automated linear registration to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas based on deep neural networks. 
* At present DeepSlice only works for section cut in the coronal plane, although future versions will be compatible with sagittal and horizontal sections. 
* DeepSlice generates an XML file that can be opened with the QuickNII software. Nonlinear refinements can be applied with VisuAlign.
