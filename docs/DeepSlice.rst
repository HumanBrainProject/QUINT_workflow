* DeepSlice performes automated linear registration to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas using deep neural networks. 
* At present DeepSlice only works for section cut in the coronal plane, although future versions will be compatible with sagittal and horizontal sections. 
* It can be used to replace steps 1 and 2 of the QuickNII registration process for coronal mouse brain sections.
* DeepSlice generates an XML or JSON file that can be opened with the QuickNII software to validate the registration. Nonlinear refinements can be applied with VisuAlign.
