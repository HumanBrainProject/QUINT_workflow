* DeepSlice performes automated linear registration to the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas using deep neural networks. 
* At present DeepSlice only works for section cut in the coronal plane, although future versions will be compatible with sagittal and horizontal sections. 
* It can be used to replace steps 1 and 2 on the QuickNII page for coronal mouse brain sections.
* DeepSlice generates an XML file that can be opened with the QuickNII software. Nonlinear refinements can be applied with VisuAlign.
